## üåê Overview

Obscura is a cutting-edge privacy-focused cryptocurrency that addresses the critical shortcomings of traditional blockchain systems by providing **true financial privacy without compromise**. 

Unlike other cryptocurrencies that offer limited privacy features or require significant trade-offs, Obscura combines:

- **State-of-the-art cryptography** (dual-curve BLS12-381/Jubjub system)
- **Comprehensive privacy protection** (hiding sender, receiver, and amounts)
- **Academic rigor** with practical implementation
- **Scalable architecture** designed for real-world usage

Our mission is to create the most advanced privacy-preserving financial system that remains accessible to everyday users while meeting the highest standards of cryptographic security.

## üîÑ Cryptographic Migration

Obscura has completed its migration from curve25519-dalek/ed25519 to a dual-curve system using:

1. **BLS12-381**: A pairing-friendly curve used for zk-SNARKs and complex zero-knowledge proofs
2. **Jubjub**: An efficient elliptic curve defined over the BLS12-381 scalar field, used for signatures and commitments

This migration enables:
- More advanced privacy features through zk-SNARK integration
- Better cross-chain compatibility with other privacy-focused cryptocurrencies
- Improved performance for complex cryptographic operations

- **Signature Verification**: Strong cryptographic verification using BLS12-381 and JubJub curves
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Range proofs to verify transaction validity without revealing amounts
- **Fee Obfuscation**: Prevent transaction linkability through fee analysis

### Transaction Pool (Mempool)

- **Priority-Based Transaction Ordering**: Efficiently order transactions by fee rate
- **Size Limits and Eviction Policies**: Manage mempool resource usage
- **Transaction Validation**: Full signature and zero-knowledge proof verification
- **Double-Spend Protection**: Prevent double-spending attacks
- **Privacy-Preserving Features**:

  - Decoy transaction support

### Network Layer

- Peer discovery and management
- Block propagation with privacy enhancements
- Transaction relay with timing variation
- Tor onion routing support for enhanced network privacy
- I2P garlic routing support as an alternative anonymous routing option
- Traffic pattern obfuscation with message padding and protocol morphing

## Usage

### Configuring Privacy Levels

Obscura allows you to configure privacy levels based on your needs:

```rust
// Standard privacy (default)
let mempool = Mempool::new();

// Enhanced privacy
let mempool = Mempool::with_privacy_level(PrivacyLevel::Enhanced);

// Maximum privacy
let mempool = Mempool::with_privacy_level(PrivacyLevel::Maximum);
```

### Creating Transactions

```rust
// Create a transaction
let mut tx = Transaction {
    inputs: vec![/* ... */],
    outputs: vec![/* ... */],
    lock_time: 0,
    // ...
};

// Apply privacy features
tx.apply_confidential_transactions(&mut confidential);
tx.apply_stealth_addressing(&mut stealth, &recipient_pubkeys);
```

### Fee Recommendations

```rust
// Get fee recommendations based on priority
let low_priority_fee = mempool.get_recommended_fee(FeeEstimationPriority::Low);
let medium_priority_fee = mempool.get_recommended_fee(FeeEstimationPriority::Medium);
let high_priority_fee = mempool.get_recommended_fee(FeeEstimationPriority::High);
```

## ‚ùì FAQ & Troubleshooting

### Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
<summary><b>How does Obscura compare to other privacy coins?</b></summary>
<p>Obscura differentiates itself by implementing a dual-curve cryptographic system that enables more advanced privacy features while maintaining better cross-chain compatibility and performance for complex operations.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>What makes Obscura's approach to privacy unique?</b></summary>
<p>Unlike other cryptocurrencies that focus on one aspect of privacy, Obscura provides comprehensive protection by hiding transaction amounts, sender information, and receiver details simultaneously using cutting-edge cryptography.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Is Obscura compliant with regulations?</b></summary>
<p>Obscura provides tools for optional regulatory compliance while preserving user privacy. Organizations can implement selective disclosure when needed without compromising the entire privacy system.</p>
</details>

### Common Issues

<details>
<summary><b>Build fails with "missing dependency" error</b></summary>
<p>Ensure you have all required system libraries installed. On Ubuntu/Debian: <code>apt install build-essential libssl-dev pkg-config</code></p>
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Transaction creation fails with "invalid commitment" error</b></summary>
<p>This typically occurs when the amount values are out of the supported range. Ensure all values are positive and within the supported range (0 to 2^64-1).</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Node won't connect to the network</b></summary>
<p>Check your firewall settings to ensure the required ports are open. Obscura requires port 8733 for standard connections and port 8734 for RPC.</p>
</details>
