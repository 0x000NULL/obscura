# Crypto Module Todo List

## 1. Critical Cryptographic Issues

1. **Insecure Keypair Encryption (Critical)** - in `mod.rs`:
   - Replace XOR-based encryption with proper authenticated encryption
   - Implement proper key derivation (Argon2/PBKDF2)
   - Add authenticated encryption (AES-GCM/ChaCha20-Poly1305)
   - Implement salt handling and nonce generation
   - Remove "WARNING: This is a simplified implementation" comments after fixing

2. **Debug Print Statements in Production Code** - in `verifiable_secret_sharing.rs`:
   - Remove all debug print statements containing sensitive information
   - Replace with proper logging with appropriate log levels

3. **Constant-Time Implementation Issues** - in `side_channel_protection.rs`:
   - Review and fix `constant_time_scalar_mul` to ensure operations aren't optimized away
   - Improve masking approach for scalar operations
   - Add tests to verify constant-time properties

4. **Fixed Swap Timeout** - in `atomic_swap.rs`:
   - Replace hardcoded timeout with configurable parameter
   - Add consideration for network delays or congestion
   - Implement adaptive timeout based on network conditions

## 2. Security Weaknesses

1. **Memory Protection Concerns**:
   - Implement cross-platform memory protection APIs
   - Remove unused/unreachable code in memory protection
   - Complete guard page protection implementation for Windows

2. **Zero-Knowledge Key Management Issues**:
   - Fix polynomial index conversion issues (properly validate 1-based to 0-based conversion)
   - Address timing attack vulnerability in share verification
   - Implement atomic state transitions for DKG

3. **Security Configuration Defaults**:
   - Make `MemoryProtectionConfig` more selective about default protections
   - Replace hardcoded timeout constants with configurable values
   - Add environment-specific security profiles (high-security, standard, etc.)

## 3. Implementation Problems

1. **Debugging and Testing Issues**:
   - Remove all `println!` statements from production code
   - Expand test coverage for all critical functions
   - Complete implementation of test functions marked with `#[test]`

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Standardize on a consistent error handling approach
   - Normalize error messages across modules
   - Remove unused error variants

3. **Code Structure Problems**:
   - Eliminate duplicate functionality across modules
   - Standardize naming conventions
   - Implement `LocalPedersenCommitment::commit` with actual calculation
   - Resolve TODO items and commented out code

## 4. Enhancement Opportunities

1. **Code Modernization**:
   - Implement proper authenticated encryption for private keys
   - Standardize error handling patterns across the codebase
   - Convert inline TODOs to tracked issues

2. **Security Improvements**:
   - Enhance memory protection with proper secure allocation/deallocation
   - Add cryptographic auditing and logging mechanisms
   - Improve constant-time implementations for all critical operations

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Add configurable performance profiles for security/performance trade-offs
   - Optimize cryptographic operations for hardware acceleration
   - Profile and benchmark critical paths

4. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Add comprehensive unit and integration tests
   - Implement formal verification for critical functions
   - Add fuzz testing for all cryptographic primitives

## 5. Documentation Needs

1. **Security Documentation**:
   - Create a threat model document
   - Document cryptographic guarantees and assumptions
   - Provide usage guidelines for secure implementation patterns

## Priority Tasks

1. Fix insecure keypair encryption in mod.rs
2. Remove debug print statements with sensitive information
3. Address constant-time implementation issues
4. Standardize error handling
5. Expand test coverage for critical functions
