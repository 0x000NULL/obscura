# Obscura Configuration Module - TODO List

## Error Handling Issues

1. **Incomplete Change Detection in `privacy_registry.rs`**:
   - The `apply_preset` method only checks a few fields for changes between old and new configs
   - Need to implement a systematic approach to detect changes across all configuration fields
   - Consider implementing reflection or field-by-field comparison utilities

2. **Deserialization Issues in `propagation.rs`**:
   - The deserialized `ConfigMigration` creates a dummy function that always returns an error
   - Need to implement proper factory or builder pattern for recreating migration functions
   - Add mechanism to validate migrations after deserialization

3. **Improved Error Propagation**:
   - Create more granular error types for better client-side handling
   - Add context to errors for easier debugging
   - Implement error chaining for nested operations

## Concurrency Issues

1. **Potential Deadlocks in `privacy_registry.rs`**:
   - Risk when acquiring multiple locks (e.g., when calling `get_config_mut()` while holding other locks)
   - Implement a consistent lock acquisition order throughout the codebase
   - Consider using lock-free data structures where applicable

2. **Lock Contention**:
   - Replace fine-grained RwLocks with more efficient concurrency mechanisms
   - Consider using atomic operations for simple counters and flags
   - Implement read-copy-update (RCU) pattern for configurations with many readers

3. **Multiple Lock Inconsistency**:
   - Using separate RwLocks for multiple related fields could lead to inconsistency
   - Group related fields under a single lock
   - Use transactional updates for multi-field changes

## Security Weaknesses

1. **Insufficient Validation Rules**:
   - Missing validation against configurations that might accidentally expose sensitive data
   - Add rules for validating network exposure settings
   - Implement security level checks based on privacy requirements

2. **Missing Rate Limiting**:
   - No protection against configuration change flooding
   - Implement rate limiting for configuration changes
   - Add cooldown periods for security-sensitive configuration changes

3. **Audit Logging Improvements**:
   - Enhance audit logging for security-critical configuration changes
   - Add tamper-evident logging mechanisms
   - Implement secure transfer of audit logs to external systems

4. **Cryptographic Verification**:
   - Add signature verification for configuration changes
   - Implement configuration integrity checking
   - Prevent replay attacks on configuration changes

## Logic Errors

1. **Merge Configuration Issues in `propagation.rs`**:
   - The `merge_configurations` function doesn't handle nested structures correctly
   - Implement deep merging of configuration objects
   - Add conflict resolution strategies for nested fields

2. **Migration Path Selection Suboptimal**:
   - Current algorithm doesn't always find the optimal migration path
   - Implement Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest migration path
   - Add weights to migrations based on complexity or risk

3. **Inconsistent Defaults**:
   - Default values are scattered across different files
   - Consolidate default values in a central location
   - Add documentation for the rationale behind default values

4. **State Transition Management**:
   - Missing clear state transition rules between configuration states
   - Implement a state machine for configuration lifecycles
   - Add invariant checking between transitions

## Performance Issues

1. **Unbounded Memory Usage**:
   - Change history is stored in memory with no pruning mechanism
   - Implement time-based or count-based pruning strategies
   - Add compression for historical records

2. **Sequential Validation**:
   - Validation rules are executed sequentially
   - Parallelize validation rules execution where possible
   - Implement early-return for critical validation failures

3. **Inefficient Component Config Derivation**:
   - Component-specific configuration calculations are inefficient
   - Implement caching with proper invalidation
   - Use incremental updates instead of full recalculations

4. **Serialization Overhead**:
   - Current serialization approach may be inefficient for large configurations
   - Implement binary serialization format for internal storage
   - Add field-level change tracking to minimize serialization needs

## Missing Features

1. **Configuration Persistence**:
   - No mechanism to persist configuration changes to disk
   - Implement atomic file-based persistence
   - Add support for database storage of configurations

2. **Configuration Templates**:
   - No support for configuration templates or inheritance
   - Implement template system with inheritance
   - Add placeholder support for dynamic values

3. **Backward Compatibility**:
   - Missing support for older application versions
   - Implement compatibility layers for legacy systems
   - Add feature detection and graceful degradation

4. **Distributed Configuration**:
   - No mechanism for distributed configuration synchronization
   - Implement consensus algorithm for multi-node configurations
   - Add conflict resolution for concurrent changes

5. **Configuration Environments**:
   - Missing support for different runtime environments (dev, test, prod)
   - Implement environment-specific configuration overlays
   - Add environment detection and switching capabilities

## Code Structure Issues

1. **Responsibility Conflicts**:
   - Conflicting responsibilities between `PrivacySettingsRegistry` and `ConfigPropagator`
   - Clearly separate concerns and responsibilities
   - Implement interfaces to decouple implementation details

2. **Excessive RwLock Usage**:
   - Potential for contention with current lock usage patterns
   - Refactor to reduce lock granularity and scope
   - Use more appropriate concurrency primitives based on access patterns

3. **Inconsistent Error Handling**:
   - Error handling between modules isn't consistent
   - Standardize error types and handling patterns
   - Implement unified error reporting and logging

4. **Test Coverage Gaps**:
   - Missing tests for edge cases and failure scenarios
   - Implement comprehensive test suite
   - Add property-based testing for validation rules

## Suggested Enhancements

1. **Configuration Versioning**:
   - Implement robust versioning with automated schema migrations
   - Add version compatibility checking
   - Create tools for analyzing version differences

2. **Distributed Synchronization**:
   - Design and implement distributed configuration synchronization
   - Add conflict resolution mechanisms
   - Implement leader election for configuration authority

3. **Configuration Linting**:
   - Develop a configuration linting and compliance checking system
   - Add best practice enforcement
   - Implement privacy impact analysis for configuration changes

4. **Snapshots and Rollbacks**:
   - Implement configuration snapshots and rollback capability
   - Add versioned storage for configurations
   - Create tools for comparing configuration versions

5. **Comprehensive Audit Trail**:
   - Create a robust audit trail mechanism for security-sensitive changes
   - Implement secure storage for audit records
   - Add analytics capabilities for audit data

6. **Secrets Management**:
   - Develop integration with a secrets management system
   - Implement encryption for sensitive configuration values
   - Add access control for protected settings

7. **Dynamic Configuration**:
   - Implement hot-reloading of configuration changes
   - Add support for feature flags and dynamic toggles
   - Create monitoring for configuration effectiveness

8. **User Interface Improvements**:
   - Develop better visualization for configuration dependencies
   - Add impact analysis tools for configuration changes
   - Implement guided configuration wizards

9. **Documentation and Examples**:
   - Improve documentation coverage for configuration APIs
   - Add more examples for common configuration scenarios
   - Create visual guides for complex configuration concepts
