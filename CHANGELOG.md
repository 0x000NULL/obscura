## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- Fixed unused assignments in `src/consensus/difficulty.rs` by using the variables with `let _ = variable` pattern to avoid warnings
- Fixed borrowing issues in `src/consensus/pos.rs` in the `rotate_shards` method by:
  - Extracting necessary data from `self` before proceeding
  - Cloning `active_validators` and `validators` to avoid borrowing `self` multiple times
  - Creating a simplified version of `StakingContract` with only the necessary fields
  - Updating the call to `shard_manager.rotate_shards` to pass the simplified contract
- Added `#[derive(Clone)]` to the `ValidatorInfo` struct in `src/consensus/pos.rs` to enable cloning in the `rotate_shards` method
- Fixed unused variable in `ShardManager::new()` by using `current_time` to initialize both `last_shard_rotation` and `last_rotation`

### Improvements
- Code now compiles successfully with `cargo build`
- Fixed critical borrowing issues that were preventing compilation
- Improved code structure in the `rotate_shards` method to avoid borrowing conflicts

### Known Issues
- Multiple unused constants, fields, and methods throughout the codebase (72 Clippy warnings)
- Unnecessary borrows in `src/blockchain/mod.rs` (15+ instances)
- Missing `Default` trait implementations for several structs:
  - `UTXOSet`, `Mempool`, `DifficultyAdjuster`, `HybridValidator`, `ProofOfStake`
  - `ProofOfWork`, `RandomXVM`, `ShardManager`, `HybridConsensus`, `Node`, `Wallet`
- Improper `Arc` usage with types that are not `Send` and `Sync` in `src/consensus/pow.rs`
- Code simplifications needed in various places:
  - Using `is_empty()` instead of comparing lengths to zero
  - Using `clamp` instead of chained `min` and `max` calls
  - Replacing manual range contains checks with `RangeInclusive::contains`
  - Optimizing loops with iterators
  - Fixing redundant closures
  - Replacing manual memcpy with `copy_from_slice`
  - Using assignment operators (`+=`, `-=`, etc.) where appropriate
- Dropping references issue in `src/consensus/pos.rs`

### Next Steps
- Address the remaining Clippy warnings to improve code quality
- Implement `Default` traits for all structs with `new()` methods
- Fix unnecessary borrows and optimize code based on Clippy suggestions
- Address the `Arc` usage issue with types that are not `Send` and `Sync`
