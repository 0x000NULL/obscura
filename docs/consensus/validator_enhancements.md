## Performance-Based Rewards

The performance-based rewards system incentivizes validators to maintain high-quality service by adjusting their rewards based on measurable performance metrics.

### Performance Metrics

The system tracks the following performance metrics:

1. **Uptime**: The percentage of time a validator is online and responsive.
2. **Block Production**: The ratio of blocks successfully proposed to blocks expected.
3. **Latency**: The average time taken to propose blocks (lower is better).
4. **Vote Participation**: The percentage of consensus votes the validator participates in.

### Performance Score Calculation

Performance scores are calculated using a weighted average of the metrics:

```
performance_score = (uptime_weight * uptime_score) +
                    (block_production_weight * block_production_score) +
                    (latency_weight * latency_score) +
                    (vote_participation_weight * vote_participation_score)
```

The weights are configurable and sum to 1.0:
- `PERFORMANCE_METRIC_UPTIME_WEIGHT`: 0.3
- `PERFORMANCE_METRIC_BLOCK_PRODUCTION_WEIGHT`: 0.3
- `PERFORMANCE_METRIC_LATENCY_WEIGHT`: 0.2
- `PERFORMANCE_METRIC_VOTE_PARTICIPATION_WEIGHT`: 0.2

### Reward Multiplier

The performance score is mapped to a reward multiplier that adjusts the base reward:

```
reward_multiplier = base_reward * (PERFORMANCE_REWARD_MULTIPLIER_MIN + 
                   (performance_score * (PERFORMANCE_REWARD_MULTIPLIER_MAX - PERFORMANCE_REWARD_MULTIPLIER_MIN)))
```

Where:
- `PERFORMANCE_REWARD_MULTIPLIER_MIN`: 0.5 (50% of base reward for poor performance)
- `PERFORMANCE_REWARD_MULTIPLIER_MAX`: 1.5 (150% of base reward for excellent performance)

### Assessment Period

Performance is assessed periodically, with the assessment interval defined by `PERFORMANCE_ASSESSMENT_PERIOD` (default: 7 days). This prevents short-term fluctuations from significantly impacting rewards.

## Slashing Insurance Mechanism

The slashing insurance mechanism provides validators with protection against unintentional slashing events, reducing the risk of participating in the network.

### Insurance Pool

Validators can join the insurance pool by paying a fee calculated as a percentage of their stake:

```
insurance_fee = stake_amount * INSURANCE_POOL_FEE
```

Where `INSURANCE_POOL_FEE` is set to 0.01 (1% of stake).

### Coverage Calculation

The insurance coverage is calculated as a percentage of the validator's stake:

```
coverage_limit = stake_amount * INSURANCE_COVERAGE_PERCENTAGE
```

Where `INSURANCE_COVERAGE_PERCENTAGE` is set to 0.5 (50% of stake).

### Claim Process

When a validator is slashed, an insurance claim is automatically filed if the validator participates in the insurance pool. Claims can also be filed manually for other types of losses.

Claims are processed periodically, and approved claims result in a payout from the insurance pool to the validator, up to their coverage limit.

### Claim Validation

Claims are validated based on:
1. Validator participation in the insurance pool
2. Active coverage at the time of the event
3. Claim amount within coverage limits
4. Claim filed within the claim window (`INSURANCE_CLAIM_WINDOW`, default: 30 days)

## Validator Exit Queue

The validator exit queue ensures orderly exits from the validator set, preventing network instability from sudden mass exits.

### Exit Request

Validators can request to exit by calling `request_validator_exit()`, which adds them to the exit queue. The function returns an estimated wait time based on the validator's position in the queue.

### Queue Processing

The exit queue is processed at regular intervals defined by `EXIT_QUEUE_PROCESSING_INTERVAL` (default: 24 hours). Each processing cycle handles validators in order of stake size, with smaller stakes exiting first.

### Wait Time Calculation

Wait times are calculated based on:
1. Minimum wait time (`EXIT_QUEUE_MIN_WAIT_TIME`, default: 7 days)
2. Position in the queue
3. Processing interval
4. Maximum wait time (`EXIT_QUEUE_MAX_WAIT_TIME`, default: 30 days)

### Exit Status and Cancellation

Validators can check their exit status using `check_exit_status()` and cancel their exit request using `cancel_exit_request()` if they change their mind before processing.

### Deregistration Process

After a validator has completed the exit process, they can be fully deregistered from the system. Attempting to deregister before completing the exit process will result in an error.

## Validator Rotation Mechanism

The validator rotation mechanism ensures that the validator set changes over time, preventing long-term collusion and enhancing network security.

### Rotation Process

The rotation process works as follows:

1. Validators are tracked for consecutive epochs of service
2. After a configurable number of epochs, validators are forced to rotate out
3. New validators are selected from the waiting pool based on stake
4. A percentage of validators is rotated in each rotation interval

### Configuration Parameters

The rotation mechanism is configured with the following parameters:

- `VALIDATOR_ROTATION_INTERVAL`: The number of epochs between rotations (default: 30 epochs)
- `VALIDATOR_ROTATION_PERCENTAGE`: The percentage of validators to rotate in each interval (default: 10%)
- `VALIDATOR_MAX_CONSECUTIVE_EPOCHS`: The maximum number of consecutive epochs a validator can serve (default: 90 epochs)

### Implementation

```rust
pub fn rotate_validators(&mut self, current_epoch: u64) -> Result<Vec<Vec<u8>>, &'static str> {
    // Check if rotation is due
    if current_epoch % VALIDATOR_ROTATION_INTERVAL != 0 {
        return Ok(Vec::new());
    }
    
    // Calculate number of validators to rotate
    let rotation_count = (self.active_validators.len() * VALIDATOR_ROTATION_PERCENTAGE as usize) / 100;
    if rotation_count == 0 {
        return Ok(Vec::new());
    }
    
    // Find validators that have served for too long
    let mut long_serving_validators = self.active_validators.iter()
        .filter(|(_, info)| info.consecutive_epochs >= VALIDATOR_MAX_CONSECUTIVE_EPOCHS)
        .map(|(id, _)| id.clone())
        .collect::<Vec<Vec<u8>>>();
    
    // If not enough long-serving validators, select additional validators based on longest service
    if long_serving_validators.len() < rotation_count {
        let additional_count = rotation_count - long_serving_validators.len();
        let mut additional_validators = self.active_validators.iter()
            .filter(|(id, _)| !long_serving_validators.contains(id))
            .collect::<Vec<(&Vec<u8>, &ValidatorInfo)>>();
        
        // Sort by consecutive epochs (descending)
        additional_validators.sort_by(|a, b| b.1.consecutive_epochs.cmp(&a.1.consecutive_epochs));
        
        // Take the required number of additional validators
        for i in 0..additional_count.min(additional_validators.len()) {
            long_serving_validators.push(additional_validators[i].0.clone());
        }
    }
    
    // Rotate out the selected validators
    for validator_id in &long_serving_validators {
        self.deactivate_validator(validator_id)?;
    }
    
    // Select new validators from the waiting pool
    let new_validators = self.select_validators_from_waiting_pool(rotation_count)?;
    
    // Activate the new validators
    for validator_id in &new_validators {
        self.activate_validator(validator_id)?;
    }
    
    Ok(long_serving_validators)
}
```

### Benefits

The validator rotation mechanism provides several benefits:

1. **Enhanced Security**: Prevents long-term collusion among validators
2. **Increased Participation**: Gives more validators a chance to participate
3. **Reduced Centralization**: Prevents a fixed set of validators from controlling the network
4. **Improved Fault Tolerance**: Regularly introduces fresh validators to the network
5. **Stake Distribution**: Encourages wider distribution of stake across the network

### Integration with Other Features

The validator rotation mechanism integrates with other validator features:

1. **Performance-Based Rewards**: Performance history is preserved when validators return to the active set
2. **Slashing Insurance**: Insurance coverage continues during rotation periods
3. **Exit Queue**: Validators in the exit queue are excluded from forced rotation

## Integration

These four features work together to create a robust validator management system:

1. **Performance-based rewards** incentivize high-quality service
2. **Slashing insurance** reduces the risk of participation
3. **Exit queue** ensures network stability during validator transitions
4. **Validator rotation** prevents long-term collusion and enhances security

Together, they enhance the security, reliability, and fairness of the Obscura blockchain's Proof of Stake system.
