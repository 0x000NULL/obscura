# Staking System Documentation

## Overview
The Obscura blockchain implements a sophisticated Proof of Stake (PoS) system with advanced features including multi-asset staking, liquid staking, and cross-chain capabilities.

## Core Features

### Basic Staking
- Minimum stake requirement: 1000 OBX
- 24-hour minimum stake age
- 7-day stake lock period
- 3-day withdrawal delay
- 5% annual staking reward rate
- Daily reward compounding

### Advanced Features

#### Multi-Asset Staking
- Support for multiple stake-able assets
- Dynamic exchange rate management
- Asset-specific minimum stake requirements
- Weighted validator selection
- Risk management for exchange rates

#### Liquid Staking
- Tokenized stake representation
- Transferable staking positions
- Automated reward distribution
- Dynamic exchange rates
- Fee sharing model

#### Cross-Chain Staking
- Support for external chain assets
- Cross-chain validation
- Bridge security measures
- Multi-chain reward distribution

### Validator System

#### Validator Requirements
- Minimum stake threshold
- Performance requirements
- Hardware security standards
- Geographic distribution incentives

#### Validator Selection
- Stake-weighted random selection
- Performance-based weighting
- Diversity considerations
- Geographic distribution factors

#### Performance Metrics
- Block production rate
- Validation accuracy
- Network participation
- Response time monitoring

### Security Features

#### Slashing Conditions
- Downtime: 5% penalty
- Double signing: 20% penalty
- Malicious behavior: 50% penalty
- Progressive penalties for repeated offenses

#### Protection Mechanisms
- Grace period for unintentional downtime
- Slashing insurance
- Progressive penalty system
- Appeal process

### State Management

#### Validator States
- Active
- Jailed
- Tombstoned
- Exiting

#### State Transitions
- Activation requirements
- Jailing conditions
- Exit process
- Recovery procedures

## Implementation Details

### Staking Contract
```rust
pub struct StakingContract {
    stakes: HashMap<Vec<u8>, Stake>,
    validators: HashMap<Vec<u8>, ValidatorInfo>,
    active_validators: HashSet<Vec<u8>>,
    // ... additional fields
}
```

### Validator Info
```rust
pub struct ValidatorInfo {
    total_stake: u64,
    performance_score: f64,
    uptime: f64,
    // ... additional fields
}
```

### Configuration Parameters
```rust
const MINIMUM_STAKE: u64 = 1000;
const MINIMUM_STAKE_AGE: u64 = 24 * 60 * 60;
const STAKE_LOCK_PERIOD: u64 = 7 * 24 * 60 * 60;
const WITHDRAWAL_DELAY: u64 = 3 * 24 * 60 * 60;
```

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Stake
```rust
let result = staking_contract.create_stake(
    public_key,
    amount,
    auto_delegate
);
```

### Validator Registration
```rust
let result = staking_contract.register_validator(
    public_key,
    commission_rate,
    delegation_cap
);
```

### Reward Distribution
```rust
let rewards = staking_contract.distribute_rewards();
```

## Advanced Features

### Reputation System
- Historical performance tracking
- Weighted scoring system
- Reputation-based incentives
- Community feedback integration

### Delegation Marketplace
- Open market for delegation
- Price discovery mechanism
- Automated matching
- Reputation integration

### Geographic Distribution
- Region-based incentives
- Network latency considerations
- Decentralization metrics
- Distribution targets

### Hardware Security
