# Peer Reputation Privacy System

## Overview

The Peer Reputation Privacy System is a privacy-preserving mechanism for managing peer reputation scores in the Obscura network. It ensures that peer reputation information remains confidential while still allowing the network to make informed decisions about peer connections and rotations.

## Key Features

1. **Encrypted Reputation Storage**
   - Uses ChaCha20Poly1305 for reputation score encryption
   - Each peer has unique encryption keys and nonces
   - Reputation data is never stored in plaintext
   - Provides strong cryptographic guarantees for score privacy

2. **Privacy-Preserving Score Calculation**
   - Adds controlled noise to score calculations (±5% variation)
   - Implements score normalization to maintain valid ranges (0.0 to 1.0)
   - Includes randomization in peer selection based on scores
   - Prevents exact value leakage and score tracking

3. **Distributed Reputation Sharing**
   - Implements Shamir's Secret Sharing scheme for reputation distribution
   - Splits reputation scores into multiple shares
   - Requires multiple peers to reconstruct complete reputation data
   - Provides threshold-based security

4. **Anonymized Statistics**
   - Provides network-wide reputation statistics without exposing individual scores
   - Includes mean, standard deviation, and count metrics
   - Implements privacy-preserving aggregation methods
   - Maintains statistical utility while protecting individual privacy

## Technical Implementation

### PeerScore Structure

```rust
pub struct PeerScore {
    // ... existing fields ...
    encrypted_reputation: Option<Vec<u8>>,
    reputation_nonce: [u8; 24],
    reputation_key: [u8; 32],
    reputation_last_update: Instant,
    reputation_shares: Vec<(SocketAddr, Vec<u8>)>,
}
```

### Key Methods

#### Reputation Updates
```rust
pub fn update_reputation(&mut self, new_score: f64, peers: &[SocketAddr]) -> Result<(), &'static str>
```
- Encrypts the new reputation score using ChaCha20Poly1305
- Generates reputation shares for distribution
- Updates the peer's encrypted reputation and shares
- Returns an error if encryption fails

#### Reputation Retrieval
```rust
pub fn get_reputation(&self) -> Option<f64>
```
- Decrypts and returns the peer's reputation score
- Returns None if no encrypted reputation exists or decryption fails
- Maintains privacy by only allowing authorized access

#### Score Calculation
```rust
pub fn calculate_score(&self) -> f64
```
- Computes a composite score with privacy-preserving noise
- Combines success ratio, latency score, and diversity metrics
- Adds random noise (±5%) to prevent exact value tracking
- Normalizes final score to range [0.0, 1.0]

### Privacy Features

#### 1. Encryption
- Uses ChaCha20Poly1305 for strong encryption
- Unique key-nonce pairs per peer
- Secure key generation using system RNG
- Prevents unauthorized access to reputation data

#### 2. Share Distribution
- Implements threshold-based secret sharing
- Minimum peers required for score reconstruction
- Network diversity in share distribution
- Prevents single-peer compromise

#### 3. Score Privacy
- Controlled noise injection
- Score normalization
- Random variations in calculations
- Prevents score tracking and correlation

#### 4. Statistical Privacy
- Aggregated network statistics
- Privacy-preserving mean calculation
- Standard deviation without individual exposure
- Maintains useful metrics while protecting privacy

## Usage Examples

### Updating Peer Reputation

```rust
// Update a peer's reputation with privacy
let peer_addr = SocketAddr::new(IpAddr::V4(Ipv4Addr::new(127, 0, 0, 1)), 8333);
let new_score = 0.85;
connection_pool.update_peer_reputation(peer_addr, new_score)?;
```

### Retrieving Peer Reputation

```rust
// Get a peer's reputation score
if let Some(score) = connection_pool.get_peer_reputation(peer_addr) {
    println!("Peer reputation score: {}", score);
}
```

### Getting Network Statistics

```rust
// Get anonymized network-wide reputation statistics
let (mean, std_dev, count) = connection_pool.get_anonymized_reputation_stats();
println!("Network reputation - Mean: {}, StdDev: {}, Count: {}", mean, std_dev, count);
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Encryption Security**
   - ChaCha20Poly1305 provides strong authenticated encryption
   - Unique keys and nonces prevent replay attacks
   - Secure key generation using system RNG

2. **Share Distribution Security**
   - Threshold-based sharing prevents single point of failure
   - Network diversity in share distribution
   - Share encryption during transmission

3. **Privacy Guarantees**
   - No plaintext reputation storage
   - Noise injection prevents exact value tracking
   - Statistical privacy in aggregated metrics

4. **Attack Resistance**
   - Resistant to reputation tracking
   - Protects against correlation attacks
   - Prevents unauthorized score manipulation

## Testing

The implementation includes comprehensive test coverage:

1. **Reputation Privacy Tests**
