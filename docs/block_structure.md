# Block Structure

This document describes the implementation of the Block Structure component in the Obscura blockchain.

## Overview

The Block Structure component is responsible for managing the structure and validation of blocks in the blockchain. It includes mechanisms for timestamp validation, block size adjustment, and privacy-enhanced merkle tree structures.

## Block Time Mechanism

Obscura implements a 60-second block time mechanism with the following features:

### Timestamp Validation

- Blocks must have timestamps greater than the median of the past 11 blocks (median time past)
- Blocks cannot have timestamps more than 2 minutes in the future
- Timestamps are validated against network-synchronized time

```rust
pub fn validate_timestamp(&mut self, timestamp: u64) -> bool {
    // Check if timestamp is too far in the future
    if timestamp > adjusted_current_time + MAX_FUTURE_TIME {
        return false;
    }
    
    // Check if timestamp is before the median of past blocks
    if timestamp <= self.calculate_median_time_past() {
        return false;
    }
    
    // Update time samples and check for correlation patterns
    // ...
    
    true
}
```

### Network Time Synchronization

The blockchain maintains network time synchronization by:

- Collecting timestamps from peer nodes
- Calculating the median of peer times
- Adjusting local time with a network offset

```rust
pub fn update_network_time(&mut self, peer_times: &[u64]) {
    // Calculate median of peer times
    let median_peer_time = times[times.len() / 2];
    
    // Update network time offset
    self.network_time_offset = median_peer_time as i64 - current_time as i64;
}
```

### Privacy-Preserving Timestamp

To enhance privacy and prevent timing analysis:

- Timestamps include a small random jitter
- The jitter is deterministically derived from the timestamp itself
- This prevents correlation attacks while maintaining consensus

```rust
pub fn add_timestamp_jitter(&self, timestamp: u64) -> u64 {
    // Add random jitter within Â±TIME_JITTER_FACTOR of TARGET_BLOCK_TIME
    let jitter_range = (TARGET_BLOCK_TIME as f64 * TIME_JITTER_FACTOR) as u64;
    
    // Simple deterministic jitter based on timestamp itself
    let jitter = timestamp % (jitter_range * 2);
    
    if jitter < jitter_range {
        timestamp + jitter
    } else {
        timestamp - (jitter - jitter_range)
    }
}
```

### Time-Based Correlation Protection

The system detects and prevents time-based correlation attacks by:

- Monitoring time differences between blocks
- Calculating statistical properties (mean, variance, standard deviation)
- Detecting suspiciously regular patterns in block timestamps

```rust
fn detect_time_correlation(&self) -> bool {
    // Calculate coefficient of variation
    let coefficient_of_variation = std_dev / mean;
    
    // Coefficient of variation below 0.1 indicates very regular intervals
    coefficient_of_variation < 0.1
}
```

## Dynamic Block Size Adjustment

Obscura implements a dynamic block size adjustment mechanism to adapt to network conditions:

### Median Block Size Calculation

- Tracks the sizes of the last 100 blocks
- Calculates the median size to determine the trend
- Adjusts the maximum block size based on this median

```rust
pub fn update_block_size_limit(&mut self, block_size: usize) {
    // Calculate median block size
    let median_size = sizes[sizes.len() / 2];
    
    // Apply growth/shrink limits
    // ...
}
```

### Growth Rate Limiting

- Maximum growth rate is limited to 10% per adjustment
- Maximum shrink rate is limited to 10% per adjustment
- Absolute minimum and maximum sizes are enforced

```rust
// Apply growth/shrink limits
let max_size = (self.current_max_block_size as f64 * BLOCK_GROWTH_LIMIT) as usize;
let min_size = (self.current_max_block_size as f64 * BLOCK_SHRINK_LIMIT) as usize;

// Calculate new block size with limits
let mut new_size = if median_size > self.current_max_block_size {
    // Growing - limit to max_size
    std::cmp::min(median_size, max_size)
} else {
    // Shrinking - limit to min_size
    std::cmp::max(median_size, min_size)
};

// Enforce absolute limits
new_size = std::cmp::max(new_size, MIN_BLOCK_SIZE);
new_size = std::cmp::min(new_size, MAX_BLOCK_SIZE);
```

### Privacy-Enhancing Padding

- Adds deterministic but unpredictable padding to blocks
- Padding size is derived from the block hash
- This prevents transaction count analysis

```rust
pub fn add_privacy_padding(&self, block: &mut Block) {
    // Generate deterministic but unpredictable padding size
    let block_hash = block.hash();
    let padding_seed = (block_hash[0] as usize) << 8 | (block_hash[1] as usize);
    let padding_size = PRIVACY_PADDING_MIN + (padding_seed % (PRIVACY_PADDING_MAX - PRIVACY_PADDING_MIN));
    
    // Add padding transaction with appropriate size
    // ...
}
```

### Transaction Batching for Privacy

- Groups transactions into batches of at least 5 transactions
- Enhances privacy by making individual transactions harder to identify
- Improves processing efficiency

```rust
pub fn batch_transactions(&self, transactions: Vec<Transaction>) -> Vec<Vec<Transaction>> {
    if transactions.len() <= TX_BATCH_MIN_SIZE {
        return vec![transactions];
    }
    
    let batch_count = transactions.len() / TX_BATCH_MIN_SIZE;
    let mut batches = Vec::with_capacity(batch_count);
    
    for chunk in transactions.chunks(TX_BATCH_MIN_SIZE) {
        batches.push(chunk.to_vec());
    }
    
    batches
}
```

## Transaction Merkle Tree Structure

Obscura implements a privacy-enhanced merkle tree structure for transactions:

### Binary Merkle Tree

- Standard binary merkle tree implementation
- Duplicates the last element when there's an odd number of elements
- Efficient O(log n) proof size

### Transaction Commitment Scheme

- Transactions are hashed with a salt for privacy
- The salt is unique to each block
- This prevents correlation attacks across blocks

```rust
pub fn calculate_privacy_merkle_root(&self, transactions: &[Transaction]) -> [u8; 32] {
    // First calculate transaction hashes with salt for privacy
    let mut hashes: Vec<[u8; 32]> = transactions
        .iter()
        .map(|tx| {
            let mut hasher = Sha256::new();
            // Hash transaction data with salt
            hasher.update(&tx.lock_time.to_le_bytes());
            hasher.update(&self.merkle_salt);
            // ...
        })
        .collect();
    
    // Build the merkle tree
    // ...
}
```

### Merkle Proof Verification

- Creates and verifies merkle inclusion proofs
- Proofs allow lightweight clients to verify transactions
- Efficient verification without downloading the entire block

```rust
pub fn verify_merkle_proof(
    &self,
    tx_hash: [u8; 32],
    merkle_root: [u8; 32],
    proof: &[[u8; 32]],
    tx_index: usize,
) -> bool {
    let mut computed_hash = tx_hash;
    
    for sibling in proof {
        // Hash with sibling based on position
        // ...
    }
    
    computed_hash == merkle_root
}
```

### Privacy-Enhanced Commitments

- Uses salted hashes for transaction commitments
- The salt is derived from block data
- Enhances privacy while maintaining verifiability

### Zero-Knowledge Friendly Structures

- Implements multiple hash iterations for ZK-friendliness
- Designed to be compatible with zero-knowledge proof systems
- Enables future privacy features

```rust
// Additional iterations for ZK-friendly structure
let mut result = hasher.finalize();
for _ in 1..ZK_FRIENDLY_HASH_ITERATIONS {
    let mut hasher = Sha256::new();
    hasher.update(&result);
    result = hasher.finalize();
}
```

## Usage

The `BlockStructureManager` is the main interface for interacting with the block structure functionality:

```rust
// Create a new manager
let mut manager = BlockStructureManager::new();

// Validate a block timestamp
if block.validate_timestamp(&mut manager) {
    // Timestamp is valid
}

// Update block size limit based on a new block
manager.update_block_size_limit(block_size);

// Calculate privacy-enhanced merkle root
let merkle_root = manager.calculate_privacy_merkle_root(&transactions);

// Create a merkle proof for a transaction
let proof = manager.create_merkle_proof(&transactions, tx_index);

// Verify a merkle proof
let is_valid = manager.verify_merkle_proof(tx_hash, merkle_root, &proof, tx_index);
```

## Testing

## Future Improvements

Potential future improvements to the block structure include:
