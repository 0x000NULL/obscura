# Peer Reputation Privacy System - Design Document

## Design Philosophy

The Peer Reputation Privacy System was designed with the following core principles:

1. **Privacy by Design**: Privacy is not an add-on feature but a fundamental aspect of the system's architecture.
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of privacy protection working together.
3. **Usability**: Privacy features should not significantly impact system performance or usability.
4. **Scalability**: The system should work efficiently with both small and large peer networks.

## Design Decisions

### 1. Choice of Encryption Algorithm

#### Decision
ChaCha20Poly1305 was chosen as the primary encryption algorithm.

#### Rationale
1. **Performance**: 
   - Faster than AES on most modern hardware
   - Particularly efficient on mobile and low-power devices
   - No need for hardware acceleration

2. **Security**:
   - Strong security guarantees
   - Well-audited and widely used
   - Provides authenticated encryption
   - 256-bit security level

3. **Implementation**:
   - Simple to implement correctly
   - Less prone to timing attacks
   - No padding requirements

### 2. Reputation Score Privacy

#### Decision
Implemented a multi-layered approach to score privacy:
1. Encrypted storage
2. Noise injection
3. Share distribution
4. Statistical anonymization

#### Rationale
1. **Encrypted Storage**:
   - Prevents unauthorized access
   - Protects against data breaches
   - Ensures confidentiality at rest

2. **Noise Injection**:
   - Prevents exact score tracking
   - Makes correlation attacks harder
   - Maintains score utility while adding privacy

3. **Share Distribution**:
   - Prevents single point of compromise
   - Requires cooperation for score reconstruction
   - Enhances network resilience

4. **Statistical Anonymization**:
   - Allows useful network metrics
   - Protects individual privacy
   - Supports decision-making

### 3. Share Generation and Distribution

#### Decision
Used a simplified secret sharing scheme based on XOR operations instead of full Shamir's Secret Sharing.

#### Rationale
1. **Performance**:
   - XOR operations are extremely fast
   - Lower computational overhead
   - Reduced network traffic

2. **Implementation Simplicity**:
   - Easier to implement correctly
   - Fewer potential bugs
   - Simpler to audit

3. **Adequate Security**:
   - Meets security requirements
   - Provides threshold security
   - Resistant to basic attacks

### 4. Score Calculation Privacy

#### Decision
Added controlled random noise to score calculations with specific characteristics:
- Maximum 5% variation
- Three-component weighting system
- Normalized output range

#### Rationale
1. **Noise Level**:
   - 5% provides meaningful privacy
   - Maintains score utility
   - Acceptable accuracy trade-off

2. **Component Weighting**:
   - Balances different metrics
   - Reduces impact of individual components
   - Makes score manipulation harder

3. **Normalization**:
   - Ensures consistent range
   - Simplifies score comparison
   - Aids in statistical analysis

### 5. Thread Safety and Concurrency

#### Decision
Used Arc<RwLock<>> for shared data structures and implemented thread-safe operations.

#### Rationale
1. **Data Safety**:
   - Prevents race conditions
   - Ensures data consistency
   - Supports concurrent access

2. **Performance**:
   - Read-heavy workload optimization
   - Minimal contention
   - Scalable design

3. **Implementation**:
   - Standard Rust patterns
   - Well-understood semantics
   - Easy to maintain
