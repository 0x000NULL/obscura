# Key Compartmentalization System

## Overview

The key compartmentalization system provides strong isolation and separation between different key usages in the Obscura blockchain. This system enhances security by preventing unauthorized access between different key purposes and enforcing strict security requirements for each compartment.

## Features

### 1. Compartment Management

- **Security Levels**
  - Standard (128-bit security)
  - Enhanced (192-bit security)
  - Critical (256-bit security)
  - UltraSecure (384-bit security)

- **Security Requirements**
  - Configurable minimum entropy requirements
  - Optional HSM (Hardware Security Module) requirement
  - Mandatory audit logging for critical compartments
  - Customizable access control lists

### 2. Access Control

- **Cross-Compartment Rules**
  - Explicit access rule definition
  - One-way access relationships
  - Rule-based access validation
  - Compartment isolation enforcement

- **Context Management**
  - Purpose-specific contexts
  - Allowed context lists
  - Context-based access control
  - Usage pattern monitoring

### 3. Usage Tracking

- **Comprehensive Monitoring**
  - Operation counting
  - Access timestamps
  - Pattern analysis
  - Usage history

- **Audit Logging**
  - Detailed event logging
  - Operation tracking
  - Access monitoring
  - Security incident logging

### 4. Key Rotation

- **Rotation Policies**
  - Time-based rotation
  - Usage-based rotation
  - Security-triggered rotation
  - Emergency rotation support

- **Rotation Management**
  - Policy enforcement
  - History tracking
  - Audit logging
  - Secure key transition

## Implementation

### Creating Compartments

```rust
let mut compartmentalization = KeyCompartmentalization::new();

// Create a standard security compartment
compartmentalization.create_compartment(
    "payments",
    "payment_processing",
    SecurityLevel::Standard,
    false
)?;

// Create a critical security compartment with HSM
compartmentalization.create_compartment(
    "master_keys",
    "key_generation",
    SecurityLevel::Critical,
    true
)?;
```

### Managing Access Rules

```rust
// Allow payments compartment to access transaction signing
compartmentalization.add_access_rule("payments", "signing")?;

// Check if access is allowed
if compartmentalization.check_cross_compartment_access("payments", "signing") {
    // Perform cross-compartment operation
}
```

### Key Derivation in Compartments

```rust
// Derive a key within a compartment
let derived_key = compartmentalization.derive_key_in_compartment(
    "payments",
    &base_key,
    "transaction_signing",
    Some(&additional_entropy)
)?;
```

### Key Rotation

```rust
// Rotate keys in a compartment
compartmentalization.rotate_compartment_keys(
    "payments",
    &mut key_protection
)?;
```

## Security Considerations

### 1. Compartment Isolation

- Each compartment maintains strict isolation from others
- Cross-compartment access requires explicit rules
- Different security levels cannot be mixed without authorization
- HSM requirements are strictly enforced

### 2. Access Control

- Access rules are unidirectional
- Rules cannot be modified without proper authorization
- Access attempts are logged and monitored
- Failed access attempts trigger security alerts

### 3. Audit Logging

- All critical operations are logged
- Audit logs are tamper-resistant
- Log entries include detailed context
- Security incidents are prominently marked

### 4. Key Protection

- Keys never leave their assigned compartments
- Cross-compartment operations use secure protocols
- Key material is protected according to compartment level
- HSM integration provides hardware-level security

## Best Practices

### 1. Compartment Design

- Create separate compartments for different purposes
- Use appropriate security levels for each compartment
- Enable HSM for critical compartments
- Implement strict access control policies

### 2. Access Rules

- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Review access rules regularly
- Monitor cross-compartment access patterns
- Update rules based on security requirements

### 3. Key Management

- Rotate keys according to security policies
- Monitor key usage patterns
- Implement emergency rotation procedures
- Maintain secure key backups

### 4. Monitoring

- Review audit logs regularly
- Monitor usage patterns for anomalies
- Track security incidents
- Implement automated alerting

## Testing

### Unit Tests

```rust
#[test]
fn test_compartment_creation() {
    let mut comp = KeyCompartmentalization::new();
    
    assert!(comp.create_compartment(
        "test",
        "testing",
        SecurityLevel::Standard,
        false
    ).is_ok());
    
    // Duplicate creation should fail
    assert!(comp.create_compartment(
        "test",
        "testing",
        SecurityLevel::Standard,
        false
    ).is_err());
}

#[test]
fn test_access_rules() {
    let mut comp = KeyCompartmentalization::new();
    
    comp.create_compartment("from", "source", SecurityLevel::Standard, false).unwrap();
    comp.create_compartment("to", "destination", SecurityLevel::Standard, false).unwrap();
    
    assert!(comp.add_access_rule("from", "to").is_ok());
    assert!(comp.check_cross_compartment_access("from", "to"));
    assert!(!comp.check_cross_compartment_access("to", "from"));
}
```
