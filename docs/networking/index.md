# Networking

This directory contains documentation about the networking layer of Obscura.

## Overview

Obscura's networking layer is designed to be robust, efficient, and privacy-preserving. It includes features like:

- Peer-to-peer communication
- Privacy-focused network routing (Tor and I2P)
- DNS-over-HTTPS for enhanced privacy
- Message encryption
- Network anonymity

## Protocols

- [P2P Protocol](p2p_protocol.md): Overview of the peer-to-peer protocol
- [Handshake Protocol](handshake_protocol.md): How peers establish connections
- [Block Announcement Protocol](block_announcement_protocol.md): How new blocks are announced
- [Anonymous Routing](anonymous_routing.md): How Tor and I2P integration works
- [Protocol Morphing](protocol_morphing.md): How network traffic is disguised as other protocols

## Components

- [Connection Management](connection_management.md): How connections are managed
- [Block Propagation](block_propagation.md): How blocks are efficiently propagated
- [Anonymous Routing](anonymous_routing.md): Features for Tor and I2P support
- [DNS-over-HTTPS](dns_over_https.md): Encrypted seed node discovery
- [I2P Proxy](i2p_proxy.md): Integration with the I2P network
- [Fingerprinting Protection](fingerprinting_protection.md): Countermeasures against client fingerprinting

## Advanced Topics

- [Traffic Pattern Obfuscation](traffic_pattern_obfuscation.md): How traffic patterns are obfuscated
- [Protocol Morphing](protocol_morphing.md): How traffic is disguised as other protocols
- [Connection Fingerprinting Protection](fingerprinting_protection.md): How client fingerprinting is prevented
- [Protocol Message Padding](message_padding.md): How messages are padded for privacy
