# Power Analysis Protection

This document describes the power analysis countermeasures implemented in the project to prevent side-channel attacks based on power consumption monitoring.

## Overview

Power analysis attacks exploit the correlation between the power consumption of a device and the operations it performs or the data it processes. These attacks can extract sensitive information by analyzing patterns in power usage during cryptographic operations. Our implementation addresses several types of power analysis attacks:

1. **Simple Power Analysis (SPA)**: Directly observing power traces to identify operations
2. **Differential Power Analysis (DPA)**: Statistical analysis of power traces to extract keys
3. **Correlation Power Analysis (CPA)**: Using correlation between predicted and actual power consumption
4. **Template Attacks**: Using pre-characterized power profiles to identify operations
5. **Higher-Order DPA**: Combining multiple power measurements to defeat basic countermeasures

## Protection Mechanisms

The following power analysis countermeasures have been implemented:

### 1. Power Usage Normalization

Power normalization ensures that operations have a consistent power profile regardless of the actual work being done, making it harder to distinguish operations by their power consumption.

Key features:
- Baseline power profile establishment
- Dynamic normalization of operations to match baseline
- Configurable normalization parameters
- Low operational overhead

### 2. Operation Balancing

Operation balancing ensures that different types of cryptographic operations have similar execution profiles and power consumption patterns, preventing attackers from distinguishing operation types.

Key features:
- Operation type tracking and balancing
- Configurable balance factor for performance tuning
- Automatic counter reset to prevent overflow
- Per-operation-type balancing statistics

### 3. Dummy Operations

Dummy operations are additional meaningless operations that are executed alongside real operations to make it harder to isolate the power consumption of the actual cryptographic operations.

Key features:
- Configurable percentage of dummy operations
- Random selection of when to add dummy operations
- Operation type preservation (dummy ops match real ops)
- Random execution order of real and dummy operations

### 4. Power Analysis Resistant Implementations

Specialized implementations of cryptographic algorithms designed to be resistant to power analysis attacks through constant-power-profile execution.

Key features:
- Double-and-add-always algorithm for scalar multiplication
- Montgomery ladder implementation
- Scalar splitting and masking
- Multiple resistance levels with increasing security and performance cost

### 5. Hardware-Specific Countermeasures

Platform-specific optimizations and protections that leverage hardware features to mitigate power analysis risks.

Key features:
- Platform detection and adaptation
- Generic fallback for unsupported platforms
- Extension points for specialized hardware support
- Configurable hardware-specific options

## Configuration

Power analysis protection can be configured through the `PowerAnalysisConfig` struct:

```rust
pub struct PowerAnalysisConfig {
    // Power usage normalization
    pub normalization_enabled: bool,
    pub normalization_baseline_ops: usize,
    
    // Operation balancing
    pub operation_balancing_enabled: bool,
    pub balance_factor: usize,
    
    // Dummy operations
    pub dummy_operations_enabled: bool,
    pub dummy_operation_percentage: u8,
    pub max_dummy_operations: usize,
    
    // Resistant algorithms
    pub resistant_algorithms_enabled: bool,
    pub resistance_level: u8,
    
    // Hardware-specific countermeasures
    pub hardware_countermeasures_enabled: bool,
    pub hardware_platform: String,
    pub hardware_options: Vec<(String, String)>,
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```rust
use obscura::crypto::power_analysis_protection::{PowerAnalysisProtection, PowerAnalysisConfig};
use obscura::crypto::jubjub::{JubjubPoint, JubjubScalar};

// Create a power analysis protection instance with default configuration
let protection = PowerAnalysisProtection::default();

// Generate test data
let point = JubjubPoint::random(&mut thread_rng());
let scalar = JubjubScalar::random(&mut thread_rng());

// Perform scalar multiplication with power analysis protection
let result = protection.protected_scalar_mul(&point, &scalar);
```

### Custom Configuration

```rust
use obscura::crypto::power_analysis_protection::{PowerAnalysisProtection, PowerAnalysisConfig};

// Create a custom configuration with high protection
let config = PowerAnalysisConfig {
    normalization_enabled: true,
    normalization_baseline_ops: 20,
    operation_balancing_enabled: true,
    balance_factor: 3,
    dummy_operations_enabled: true,
    dummy_operation_percentage: 30,
    max_dummy_operations: 8,
    resistant_algorithms_enabled: true,
    resistance_level: 5, // Maximum resistance
    hardware_countermeasures_enabled: true,
    hardware_platform: "generic".to_string(),
    ..PowerAnalysisConfig::default()
};

// Create a protection instance with custom configuration
let protection = PowerAnalysisProtection::new(config, None);
```

### Using Resistant Algorithm Implementations

```rust
use obscura::crypto::power_analysis_protection::PowerAnalysisProtection;
use obscura::crypto::jubjub::{JubjubPoint, JubjubScalar};

// Create a protection instance
let protection = PowerAnalysisProtection::default();

// Use a specialized power analysis resistant algorithm
let point = JubjubPoint::random(&mut thread_rng());
let scalar = JubjubScalar::random(&mut thread_rng());

// This uses the specific resistance algorithm based on the configuration
let result = protection.resistant_scalar_mul(&point, &scalar);
```

### Normalizing Power Consumption

```rust
use obscura::crypto::power_analysis_protection::PowerAnalysisProtection;

// Create a protection instance
let protection = PowerAnalysisProtection::default();

// Normalize an operation to have consistent power profile
let result = protection.normalize_operation(|| {
    // Your cryptographic operation here
    perform_sensitive_operation()
});
```

### Integration with Other Protections

```rust
use obscura::crypto::power_analysis_protection::PowerAnalysisProtection;
use obscura::crypto::side_channel_protection::SideChannelProtection;
use obscura::crypto::memory_protection::MemoryProtection;
use std::sync::Arc;

// Create all protection instances
let scp = Arc::new(SideChannelProtection::default());
let mp = MemoryProtection::new(Default::default(), Some(scp.clone()));
let pap = PowerAnalysisProtection::new(Default::default(), Some(scp.clone()));

// Use combined protections for maximum security
let result = pap.protected_operation(|| {
    // This operation is protected against power analysis, side-channel, and memory attacks
    perform_very_sensitive_operation()
});
```

## Power Analysis Resistant Algorithms

The module provides several specialized algorithm implementations designed to resist power analysis attacks:

### 1. Double-and-Add-Always Algorithm (Level 1)

This algorithm always performs both double and add operations regardless of the scalar bit values, preventing simple power analysis that would otherwise be able to distinguish between bit values.

```rust
// Performs double and add operations for every bit regardless of the bit value
for bit in scalar_bits.iter().rev() {
    // Always double
    result = result.double();
    
    // Always compute addition result
    let addition = result + point;
    
    // Conditionally use the addition result
    if bit {
        result = addition;
    }
}
```

### 2. Montgomery Ladder Algorithm (Level 2)

The Montgomery ladder maintains two point values and updates both in each iteration, providing a more balanced execution pattern that's resistant to simple and some differential power analysis.

```rust
// Montgomery ladder algorithm with constant pattern of point operations
for bit in scalar_bits.iter().rev() {
    if bit {
        r0 = r0 + r1;
        r1 = r1.double();
    } else {
        r1 = r0 + r1;
        r0 = r0.double();
    }
}
```

### 3. Scalar Splitting with Masking (Levels 3-5)

Higher security levels use scalar splitting with blinding factors to further obscure the operations and resist sophisticated differential power analysis.

Level 3: Basic scalar splitting with single blinding factor
Level 4: Scalar splitting with additional random masks and extra rounds
Level 5: Maximum masking with multiple blinding factors and additional operations

## Performance Considerations

Power analysis protections come with performance trade-offs:

1. **Power normalization**: Adds overhead to make all operations take consistent time
2. **Operation balancing**: May execute operations multiple times to balance execution patterns
3. **Dummy operations**: Adds additional operations that don't contribute to the result
4. **Resistant algorithms**: Use less optimized but more secure implementations
5. **Hardware countermeasures**: May reconfigure hardware features, affecting performance

Configure the level of protection based on your security requirements and performance constraints.

## Security Guarantees and Limitations

The power analysis protection system provides:

- Strong protection against simple power analysis (SPA)
- Significant protection against differential power analysis (DPA)
- Basic protection against higher-order DPA and template attacks
- Platform-specific mitigations where available

Limitations to be aware of:

- Cannot completely eliminate all power consumption side-channels
- Hardware-specific attacks may still be effective on some platforms
- Very sophisticated attacks using specialized equipment might still work
- Performance impact increases with protection level

## Integration with Other Security Features

Power analysis protection works best when combined with:

- Side-channel attack protection (timing, cache, etc.)
- Memory protection mechanisms
- Secure coding practices
- Proper key management
- Physical security measures

## Future Improvements

Potential future enhancements:

1. **Hardware accelerated countermeasures** for specific platforms
2. **Advanced masking schemes** using threshold implementations
3. **Formal verification** of power analysis resistance 
4. **Machine learning based countermeasures** adapting to attack patterns
5. **Custom hardware support** for specialized security chips
