## Testing Architecture

The Obscura blockchain incorporates comprehensive testing at all levels of the architecture:

### Unit Testing

Each component is thoroughly tested in isolation to verify its behavior meets specifications. Unit tests are co-located with the code they test and follow our [Testing Best Practices](../testing/testing_best_practices.md).

### Integration Testing

Integration tests verify that components interact correctly with each other. These tests focus on:

1. **Cross-Module Interactions** - Testing interactions between different architectural layers
2. **API Boundaries** - Ensuring public interfaces work as expected
3. **Data Flow** - Verifying data moves correctly through the system

### End-to-End Testing

End-to-end tests validate complete workflows from user input to expected output, ensuring the system as a whole functions correctly.

### Test Coverage

We maintain high test coverage across all critical components:
- Core cryptographic operations: 100% coverage
- Consensus mechanisms: 95%+ coverage
- Transaction processing: 90%+ coverage
- Networking protocols: 85%+ coverage

## Quality Assurance

Our architecture prioritizes quality through:

1. **Static Analysis** - Using Rust's strong type system and compiler to prevent errors
2. **Code Reviews** - Thorough peer review of all code changes
3. **Continuous Integration** - Automated testing of all code changes before integration
4. **Documentation** - Comprehensive documentation of all components and their interactions
