# Mining Implementation Documentation

## Overview
Obscura's mining system is built around RandomX for ASIC resistance and CPU optimization.

## Components

### Mining Manager
- Thread management
- Work distribution
- Hash rate monitoring
- Solution verification

### Block Template Creation
- Transaction selection
- Fee calculation
- Coinbase creation
- Merkle root computation

### Mining Loop
1. Get block template
2. Update header timestamp
3. Increment nonce
4. Calculate RandomX hash
5. Check against target
6. Submit if valid

### Performance Optimization
- Thread count auto-configuration
- Memory allocation strategies
- Cache utilization
- Dataset management

### Mining Modes
- Solo mining
- Future: Pool protocol
- Future: Stratum V2 support
- Hybrid staking integration
