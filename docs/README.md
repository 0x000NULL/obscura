## Contributing to Documentation

When contributing to the documentation, please follow these guidelines:

1. **File Organization**: Place documentation files in the appropriate directory based on their topic.
2. **File Naming**: Use lowercase names with underscores for spaces (e.g., `file_name.md`).
3. **Index Files**: Each directory should have an `index.md` file that serves as an entry point for that section.
4. **Cross-References**: Use relative paths for links to other documentation files.
5. **Code Examples**: Include code examples where appropriate, using proper syntax highlighting.
6. **Images**: Place images in an `images/` directory within the relevant section.

## Building the Documentation

The documentation is written in Markdown and can be built into a static website using a documentation generator such as MkDocs or Docusaurus. Instructions for building the documentation can be found in the [Development Guide](development.md).
