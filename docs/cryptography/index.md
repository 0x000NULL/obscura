## Cryptographic Foundations

Obscura's cryptography is built on solid mathematical foundations:

- **Elliptic Curve Cryptography**: Using both Ristretto and Jubjub curves for different use cases
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Enabling verification without revealing sensitive information
- **Homomorphic Properties**: Allowing operations on encrypted or committed values
- **Secure Hash Functions**: SHA-256 and other cryptographic hash functions

## Security Focus

All cryptographic implementations in Obscura are designed with:

- **Constant-time operations** to prevent timing attacks
- **Memory safety** to protect sensitive cryptographic material
- **Strong entropy sources** for random number generation
- **Forward secrecy** to protect past transactions

## Roadmap and Future Work

Upcoming cryptographic features include:

- **Range Proofs**: Bulletproofs implementation for proving value ranges
- **Enhanced Zero-Knowledge Systems**: More efficient and flexible zk-proofs
- **Post-Quantum Research**: Investigation of quantum-resistant alternatives
- **Hardware Security Integration**: Support for hardware security modules
