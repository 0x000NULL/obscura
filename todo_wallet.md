# Wallet Module: Issues and Areas for Improvement

1. **Weak Error Handling**:
   - Replace `Option<Transaction>` returns with proper `Result` types that provide context about failures
   - Implement structured error types instead of generic string errors

2. **Incomplete Privacy Implementation**:
   - Add proper validation and security checks to stealth addressing
   - Complete the `decrypt_amount` function with actual decryption logic
   - Replace placeholder logic with real implementations

3. **Missing Transaction Validation**:
   - Implement comprehensive input and output validation
   - Add checks for malicious transaction patterns

4. **Security Vulnerabilities**:
   - Encrypt private keys in `WalletBackupData`
   - Improve encryption/decryption mechanisms for `export_bls_keypair` and `import_bls_keypair`

5. **Race Conditions**:
   - Implement consistent lock ordering to prevent deadlocks
   - Review lock acquisition patterns in `integration.rs`

6. **Incomplete Test Coverage**:
   - Add tests for BLS signing, view key operations, and confidential transactions
   - Enhance existing tests to cover edge cases and failure scenarios

7. **Unimplemented Features**:
   - Complete confidential transactions implementation
   - Implement proper range proofs for transaction amounts
   - Replace placeholder implementations with actual functionality

8. **Memory Management Issues**:
   - Reduce unnecessary cloning of large data structures
   - Add explicit management for memory-sensitive data like private keys

9. **Dust UTXO Handling**:
   - Clarify and improve dust UTXO handling logic
   - Add consistent dust threshold policy

10. **Inefficient UTXO Selection**:
    - Optimize UTXO selection for privacy and fee efficiency
    - Consider UTXO age and other factors in selection algorithm

11. **Thread Safety Issues**:
    - Review lock patterns in `WalletIntegration` to prevent deadlocks
    - Ensure consistent lock acquisition order

12. **Poor Documentation**:
    - Add detailed documentation for complex functions
    - Document privacy features and their security implications

13. **Inconsistent State Management**:
    - Ensure atomic operations for functions like `submit_transaction`
    - Implement rollback mechanisms for partial failures

14. **Hard-coded Values**:
    - Make fee calculation parameters configurable
    - Convert hard-coded thresholds to configurable values

15. **Missing Transaction Fee Optimization**:
    - Implement dynamic fee adjustment based on network conditions
    - Add fee estimation API for better user experience

16. **Lack of Recovery Mechanisms**:
    - Add clear path for wallet recovery if private keys are lost
    - Implement emergency functions for extreme situations

17. **Incomplete Protection Against Side-Channel Attacks**:
    - Add measures against timing attacks for sensitive crypto operations

18. **Missing Integration with External Hardware**:
    - Add support for hardware security modules or external signers

19. **Overuse of Debug Derives**:
    - Remove `Debug` trait implementations from sensitive structures
    - Add safe debug alternatives that don't leak private information

20. **Synchronization Issues**:
    - Implement robust synchronization mechanism for concurrent operations
